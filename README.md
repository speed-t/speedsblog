# Speed's Blog

<h1>My personal blog</h1>

<p>This is the repository for my static blog website. The idea is to post blog posts and pictures on the website much like someone would do for social media. However, I'm not on social media, and I think that websites are a fun way to still share a little about life without all of the crazy people that social media bring</p>

<p>This will also be a place where I test very simple front end website stuff and try my best to make something look really good. For example, this entire website will only be built with html, css, and javascript (with some help from bootstrap). It will also be hosted completely with github pages. My goal is to make something that looks really good, runs blazing fast, and has a few nice features like:

<ul>
<li>rss subscription</li>
<li>simple and smooth animations</li>
<li>really nice pictures and photo albums</li>
<li>an easy way to navigate old blog posts</li>
<li>maybe more</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>That's all!</h2>
